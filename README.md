# shelly-webui

## Description

This project is a stand-alone web application that allows local control of Shelly 
smart home devices, without having to install a slow-ish App or suddendly requiring 
a mandatory Cloud account (Looking at you, Shelly Ltd! ðŸ˜¡).
Everything is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`. 

This is currently in an early proof-of-concept state. Thus, the only things working
right now are:
- adding and removing devices
- controlling Shelly 2 roller switches

Support is planned for:
- other Gen1 devices
- Authentication
- Exporting/Importing profiles to share them on multiple browser instances
